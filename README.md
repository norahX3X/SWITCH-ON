## About
One common way for motivating children is games. Recently, children spend their time either plays games on their own handheld/mobile devices or play console-based games (for example: Xbox, PS4). Exergames have emerged as a way of combining exercise with digital gaming to gain the entertainment element of the game and blend it with fitness, and it has been shown to yield physical benefits for children [5]. The recent console video games such as Xbox Kinect allows players to physically interact with the game. However, the biggest limitation of console exergames is that they require a computer monitor or television set to operate and cannot be played outdoors as in the case of a mobile device.

The objective of this project is to motivate children between the age of 5 to 10 years old to improve their fitness using the trendiest technologies among them, which are mobile phones and tablets in an entertaining way. One of the recent interests focuses on the area of mini-games – short, self-contained games, usually based around a single principle [8]. The concept is to develop mobile exergame application” Switch On” that has a sequence of levels that are designed to motivate children to physically move in order to win the game. The levels rely on Augmented Reality (AR) where the objects are distributed around the player. Also, motion sensors were used to capture the players movement in the real world. Studies show that most children like to play physical games [9]. For that, this project applied mobile AR and mobile motion sensors to develop mini-games. In this game, the user has to perform some physical activities such as walking and jumping in order to win the game.
